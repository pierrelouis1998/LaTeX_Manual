## LaTeX_Manual 

My plan is to write a complete and well-rounded manual about the LaTeX language suited for those studying at ENPC which will include (non-exhaustive list):
* A part explaining the basic syntax and how to get started on simple document
* Chapters which will be made on a "CookBook" based on what a first year student have to do
* More advanced stuffs for those willing to improve
* Templates for the various projects
