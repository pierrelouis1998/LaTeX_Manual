## LaTeX_Manual 
### What's the plan ?
My plan is to write a complete and well-rounded manual about the LaTeX language suited for those studying at ENPC which will include (non-exhaustive list):
* A part explaining the basic syntax and how to get started on simple document
* Chapters which will be made on a "CookBook" based on what a first year student have to do
* More advanced stuffs for those willing to improve
* Templates for the various projects 
### Why such a project ?
It came accross that the "formation" made by the KI where not perfectly suited for what the students had to do in the sense that the time granted to explanation and pure teaching was too high compared to the pratice time.
In that regard, I decided to write a manual which will answer all the *theoritical* questions one can have to make the "formation" more focused on the actual writing and not learning. The idea would be that one can come to this formation already knowing the base of LaTeX, to seek help for more advanced question (or just troubleshooting).
### When will it be available ?
Before the begining of next year (2021) class **I hope**, I will maybe be releasing a first version with all the necessary stuff and then complete it during the year.
